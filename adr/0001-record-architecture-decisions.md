# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-10-9

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

> This is inspired from Michael Nygard's [article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

One ADR describes one significant decision for a specific project. It should be something that has an effect on how the rest of the project will run. The consequences of one ADR are very likely to become the context for subsequent ADRs. Developers and project stakeholders can see the ADRs, even as the team composition changes over time.

The motivation behind previous decisions is visible for everyone, present and future. Nobody is left scratching their heads to understand, "What were they thinking?" and the time to change old decisions will be clear from changes in the project's context.
